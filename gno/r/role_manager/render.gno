// goal is to render the role manager
// should display the roles a bit like discord does with vertical hierarchy
// main page will display a maximum of 3 permissions per role and a link to the role page
// the role page /{role_name]  will display all permissions and 5 users with the role
// a page to check all the roles of a user /{user_address} will display all roles of the user
